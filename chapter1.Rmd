## Some feelings after the first week
It has been quite a heavy crash course into the world of R. the book is good, especially with the exercises and notes in the markdown file, but it's massive for a beginner, like me.

With the R syntax and RStudio environment, I feel as if I was illiterate, almost, but I trust I'll get used to R with more exercises and time.

Also, I feel frustrated about my University of Helsinki laptop: I got everything running with my personal laptop, whereas UH laptop just miserably blundered in each and every step.

## My aims for the course
After this course, I wish I could work in RStudio at somewhat semi-independent level, at least when dealing with basic things. I aim to familiarize myself with R to the level where I'll be able to understand the error messages I get and the solutions I google.
